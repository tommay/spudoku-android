-- Within a square, if the only possible places for a given digit are
-- in the same row/col, then the digit can be removed from the
-- possibilities for the rest of the Unknowns in that row/col.
--
-- The reverse of the situation is also true.  In a given row or
-- column if it is only possible to place a given digit within a
-- single square, then the digit can be eliminated from the other
-- Unknowns of that square.
--
-- Each tuple in trickySets contains three lists of Unknowns.  If a
-- digit is possible in the first list but not the second, it will be
-- removed from the possibiles of the third.
--

-- After we apply a tricky set with a particular digit, it may create
-- some immediate placements:
-- - There may be 

-- - Some of the Unknowns in the eliminate set may now have only one possibility.
