Why are the same difficulty puzzles for a particular layout always the same?
Add counts to the circles at the bottom.  This can possibly be done by using
  a FrameLayout with a centered text digit stacked on top of a centered circle.

Old TODO:

Hints should not require solving the puzzle to completion.
The hint solver should use an rnd.
Display nice hints.

What is the deal with resume/rotate?

Why am I using my own util.minBy instead of the built-in one?
Oh, because it's faster.

Find Needed because it's faster then see if it's an EasyPeasy?

Create by removing half the layout at a time.  If there are multiple
solutions things need to be added in bit by bit.

When creating, terminate the solve stage when the new Unknowns have
been determined without guessing.

When we're creating a puzzle using heuristica isn't it possible that
they find only one solution even if there are really multiple
solutions?  Do we need to use allSolutions when creating then filter
for puzzles solveable with heuristics?  No . . . if the heuristics
find a placement, it is the only placement possible for that cell.
It's when they *don't* find any placements that we have to guess and
their may be multiple solutions.
