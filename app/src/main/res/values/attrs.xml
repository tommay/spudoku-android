  This file is somehow semi-automagically found and used to provide
  custom attributes to PersistentSpinner by declaring a namespace in
  activity_main.xml:
    xmlns:tommay="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/net.tommay.spudoku"
  then used:
    <net.tommay.spudoku.PersistentSpinner
        ...
        tommay:name="whatever"/>

  The attributes ends up being included in R.java

  See https://developer.android.com/training/custom-views/create-view
-->

<resources>
  <declare-styleable name="PersistentSpinner">
      <!-- Name is required.  If it isn't given then the PersistentSpinner
           constructor will throw a RuntimeException.  There is no way to make
           it required in the xml.  -->
      <attr name="name" format="string"/>
  </declare-styleable>
