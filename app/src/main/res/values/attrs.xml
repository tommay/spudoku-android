  This file is somehow semi-automagically found and used to provide
  custom attributes to PersistentSpinner by declaring a namespace in
  activity_main.xml:
    xmlns:tommay="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto"
  then used:
    <net.tommay.spudoku.PersistentSpinner
        ...
        tommay:name="whatever"/>

  The attributes ends up being included in R.java
